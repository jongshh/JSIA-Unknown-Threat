# JSIA | Unknown Threat

[![Title_Thumb](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UptqcsT9I7Q/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UptqcsT9I7Q)

**JSIA | Unknown Threat** is a contract pack for KSP Career Mode.

In the past, there were various mission packs utilizing BDA, and I started this project hoping to continue that effort in the latest version.

Currently, most of the parts used are modded rather than stock, but I also plan to release a pack made entirely of stock parts in the future.

In any case, the vehicles featured in this pack are designed to resemble real-world counterparts for enhanced realism, and the mods used are mostly different from KSP stock (e.g., using FAR).

**JSIA | Unknown Threat** involves you, a mercenary hired by JSIA, being assigned missions to destroy enemies. Current missions include SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses), air combat, ground force elimination, and fleet destruction.

Since the pack is still under development, bugs may occur, so I would appreciate it if you could report any issues in the issue tab.

Also, while I regularly check the list of dependent mods, errors may occur, so please let me know if any bugs arise!
