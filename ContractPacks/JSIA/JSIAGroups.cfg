	tip = Regarding the recent attacks on areas under JSIA's control, JSIA has maintained silence.
	tip = In response to several unfortunate attacks, JSIA has announced the promise of strong retaliation.
	tip = Pro tip: If you see a heat-seeking missile, turn off your engine afterburner, spam flares, and pray for a miss.
	tip = Pro tip: When engaging in a dogfight, stay unpredictable—erratic maneuvers can throw off enemy targeting systems.  
	tip = JSIA recommends pilots maintain formation discipline to counter enemy flanking tactics.  
	tip = Pro tip: In a head-on pass, aim for the cockpit—it's a high-risk, high-reward move, but can end the fight quickly.  
	tip = Reports indicate JSIA is equipping their interceptors with advanced ECM pods to disrupt missile locks.  
	tip = Pro tip: When pursued, use terrain to your advantage—fly low through canyons or close to mountain ranges to break line of sight.  
	tip = JSIA has deployed AWACS support to bolster air superiority by providing real-time battlefield data.  
	tip = Pro tip: Conserve fuel in prolonged engagements—running out of fuel mid-dogfight is a death sentence. 
	tip = Pro tip: When flying through heavy fog, use your instruments over visuals to avoid disorientation.  
	tip = Enemy fighters have been observed using high-G turns to evade missile locks; anticipate and counter with lead pursuit.  
	tip = Pro tip: When facing multiple opponents, force them into a vertical engagement to isolate targets one at a time.  
	tip = Pro tip: Avoid tunnel vision—constantly check your six; the most dangerous threat is the one you don’t see.  
	tip = New intelligence suggests JSIA is testing advanced thrust-vectoring fighters capable of extreme maneuverability in close-quarters combat. 
	tip = JSIA has introduced AI wingmen in high-risk missions to reduce failure rates and provide real-time tactical support.  
	tip = Pro tip: When flying with an AI wingman, synchronize your maneuvers—they react faster but rely on clear tactical input.  
	tip = Intelligence suggests JSIA’s AI wingmen are capable of autonomous decision-making, allowing them to adapt to evolving battlefield conditions.  
	tip = Pro tip: Use AI wingmen to bait enemy fighters into traps—human pilots can capitalize on the chaos their calculated moves create.  
	tip = Pro tip: Trust your AI wingman for missile defense—let them handle countermeasures while you focus on offensive maneuvers.  
	tip = JSIA’s AI wingmen are programmed to prioritize mission success over pilot survival—stay alert and avoid risky coordination errors.  
	tip = Pro tip: AI wingmen can perform precise formation flying—utilize them for complex flight patterns to overwhelm enemy defenses.
